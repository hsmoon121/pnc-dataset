# Point-and-Click Dataset

The Point-and-Click Dataset contains following data:

- Point-and-click behavioral data from multiple participants (N=20).
- Measured baseline values of each participant's cognitive characteristics (e.g., visiual perception noise, motor noise, precision of click decision-making).

## Data collection

Twenty participants performed a total of four different tasks over two days (see the figure of overview below).
For the details of data collection process & materials, please refer to the paper [1].
